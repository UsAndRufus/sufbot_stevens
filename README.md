# Sufbot Stevens
A bot to generate Sufjan Stevens lyrics using NLTK.

# Lyrics
I used a modified version of [this repo](https://github.com/stanleycyang/lyrics-scraper) to download the lyrics from [Genius.com](Genius.com)

# Acknowledgements
Thanks to [this article](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/) and [this article for](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2017/07/03/setting-up-a-python-development-environment/) advice on how to set up a proper Python repo. All my previous Python stuff has been for private consumption with no virtualenv stuff at all.

The code is heavily based on [this example](https://pythonnlp.quora.com/Generating-Random-Texts-with-NLTK) (as NLTK removed the generate function).
